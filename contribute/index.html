            <p>
                String Authority is building the permanent historical record for guitars — where instruments, models, and the people who document them accumulate verified, lasting context.
            </p>

            <p>
                This isn't a platform looking for users. It's infrastructure looking for collaborators.
            </p>

            <p>
                We're in active discovery, conducting short conversations with people across the guitar ecosystem to understand what matters, what's broken, and what should exist. If any of the following describes you, we'd like to talk.
            </p>


            <h2>Who we're looking for</h2>
            
            <div class="grid">
                <div class="card">
                    <i class="ph ph-user-circle-check icon"></i>
                    <div class="text-content">
                        <h3>Collectors & Dealers</h3>
                        <p>You track provenance, spot fakes, and understand how documentation affects value. We want to learn how you verify authenticity today — and where the gaps are.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="card">

                    <div class="text-content">
                        <h3>Builders & Luthiers</h3>
                        <p>You create instruments and know what information should travel with them. We want to understand how you document your work and what gets lost over time.</p>

                        <h3>Content Creators & Reviewers</h3>
                        <p>Your videos and articles are historical records — but they're scattered across platforms with no structured attribution. We're designing a system where your contributions become permanent, verified, and linked to the instruments and models you cover.</p>

                        <p>You research and publish the stories behind instruments. We're building infrastructure designed for citation, attribution, and permanence — and we'd like your input on what that should look like.</p>

                A 20-minute video conversation. 
                <br>
                No pitch, no demo — 
                how you work, what's broken, what should exist. No pitch, no demo. Just listening.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your input directly shapes what we build.

            <h2>Why this matters</h2>

            <p>
                <em>The guitar world runs on oral history, scattered documentation, and institutional knowledge that disappears when people retire or move on. We're building the system that should have existed decades ago — but it only works if it's shaped by the people who actually live this.</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>If you care about guitars lasting — not just physically, but as documented, attributed, knowable artifacts — we'd like to hear from you.</em>
            </p>
